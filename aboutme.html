    <h2>About My Career...</h2>
    <p>
        I have been working within the higher education field for over a decade. I started out answering phones at the front desk for the admissions office at the University of California, Irvine and have had the fortunate opportunity to take on a few different roles from there for various institutions. I’ve recruited, evaluated coursework, read thousands of applications and presented university policies at conferences. I eventually ended up landing a programmer analyst role in the admissions office of UCLA. I had no prior experience working with systems in any capacity but it was something I was always interested in. On my first day, my boss left me a book on my desk on how to learn SQL. I wish I could say I had the discipline to read that front to back but I think I got through maybe a 4th of the way until I grew impatient and started to just randomly play around in the database. Through the patience and support of my colleagues, I was eventually able to handle my own tasks and I’ve been hooked ever since. The beauty of systems roles, especially in higher education is that it can take on many forms. One day I can be cleaning up some bad characters in the database while the next day I can be developing a reporting dashboard. </br></br>
        It’s actually hard for me to concisely sum up my experience up to this point, which why is why I’ve built this website. I wanted to highlight in detail some of the projects I’ve worked on as somewhat of a showcase, but also as a reflection of my holistic experience. Each one of these projects has been a building block for the next so I feel it’s important to document my approach and determine if there were things that could’ve been done differently. I’ve found that a lot of institutions run into similar issues so I hope these write-ups can help others in similar roles as well. My contact information is available on the sidebar if you’re reading this and would like to talk shop!
