                Using Slate payments greatly streamlines the process for students to submit required payments, but how do you integrate a transcation file for your campus legacy system to consume?

                 <h1>Integrating an alternative admissions process</h1>
                 Concourse (an EAB company) has recently introduced an interesting new way for international students to be admitted into U.S. institutions. How do you integrate that with your current process?

                 <h1>Sending admissions data downstream through a legacy SIS system.</h1>
                 This campus has a homegrown, COBOL based student information system. Itâ€™s great to have something fine tuned to your campus needs specifically but what happens when your campus buys a modern software product that ends up being vital to the whole admissions process?
